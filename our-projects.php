                <br><br>
                Hamari Pahchan has launched an initiative to support our elderly by distributing comfort kits to those
                in need:


                <br><br>
                - A comfort kit for one elderly person costs Rs. 800/- and lasts for 3 months.

                - A comfort kit for one person for a year costs approximately Rs. 3120/-.


                <br><br>
                Each comfort kit for the elderly includes a hot water bag, age-appropriate medicines, a thermometer,
                blankets suitable for the season, energy drinks like Glucon D, and mosquito repellent spray.

                The number of children struggling with illiteracy in India is alarming. As per the National Sample
                Survey Office (NSSO) 32 million children in India have never even seen the face of a school. Moreover,
                the Education Ministry revealed that 29 million children do not have access to necessary digital
                devices. Current scenario highlights the need to bridge the gap between the privileged and the
                underprivileged children.
                <br><br>
                To address this issue, Hamari Pahchan has come up with the Drishti Initiative. As a part of this
                program, we conduct training sessions as well as informative workshops around themes like personality
                development, basic communication skills, computing skills and the like for children deprived of the
                opportunity to develop such skill sets. Along with the above mentioned programs, recently, we have also
                come up with the “Gadgetshala” initiative under this project.
                <br><br>
                It primarily aims to deliver Drishti Classes with the aid of the internet and gadgets in order to
                improve a child’s learning experience. Mentors are assigned to groups of children to guide them through
                the learning process and to ensure that
                they have easy access to resources.

                Every menstruator is entitled to safe and healthy periods but unfortunately, as per the latest National
                Family Health Survey report about 50 percent of women aged 15-24 still use cloth for menstrual
                protection. This calls for an urgent and prompt support from each one of us.

                We at Hamari Pahchan realize that the pressing need of the hour is to provide essential resources to the
                ones in need as soon as possible. To bring about some real change, initially we put forth an initiative
                dedicated to menstrual health awareness.
                <br><br>
                Under this initiative, we used to spread awareness regarding menstrual hygiene. During the lockdown, we
                were approached by a group of poor women who informed us about their plight with regard to menstrual
                hygiene. They requested us to provide them with the necessary support. After which we decided to provide
                the ones in need with the necessary period products. Fortunately, the response to this initiative was so
                overwhelming that we decided to push it further as a full-fledged project –‘SUKHAD.’
                <br><br>

                ‘Sukhad’ aims to provide every menstruator with access to safe and healthy periods. As a part of this
                project, we provide menstruators with menstrual kits (Sukhad kits), educate them regarding
                menstrualhygiene, and create awareness to dispel the taboo related to menstruation.

                Unemployment touched an all time high as the pandemic engulfed employment opportunities. Furthermore,
                the Periodic Labour Force Survey tells us that one in four women in urban areas is unemployed. Our youth
                and women are worst hit by the ongoing unemployment crisis; they deserve equal and ample opportunities
                to earn their livelihood.



                <br><br>
                Hamari Pahchan has been working relentlessly to provide employment opportunities to the ones in need.
                Initially, we came up with a small scale project known as ‘Vocal for local’ with an aim to provide
                unemployed women with vocational training as well as a platform to sell their produce. Fortunately, the
                response to this project turned out to be so overwhelming that we made a resolve to push it further as a
                full-fledged initiative.



                <br><br>
                This bold initiative aims to provide underprivileged women and youth with opportunities to earn a
                livelihood. Based on the concept of self sufficiency i.e. ‘Atma nirbharta’, this initiative strives to
                empower women so that they are capable enough to support themselves financially.
